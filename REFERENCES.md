# Further Details

I've implemented the core functionality that I could immediately manage and
remember.  For the future there are more things commands/statements which
are expected in a decent BASIC implementation:

* PI
* RND
* RAND
* LEN
* etc, etc.

See these two references for more complete lists:

## "Big Programs"

I implemented/ported the game from this site - after adding INPUT:

If we did ever add string-primitives then we could implement the "star
program" from here:

## Easter Eggs

Of course BASIC isn't BASIC without PEEK & POKE ..
