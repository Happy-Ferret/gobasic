# Further Details

I've implemented the core functionality that I could immediately manage and
remember.

For the futrue there are more things available:

* PI
* RND
* RAND
* LEN
* etc, etc.

See the references here for common things:

* ZX Spectrum:
  * http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/
* C64:
  * https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Category:BASIC-Command

Finally if we add more primitives there's a fun program here we should/could
support:

This example only really needs the "IF" test to be implemented, along
with the INPUT-support:

## Easter Eggs

Of course BASIC isn't BASIC without PEEK & POKE ..
